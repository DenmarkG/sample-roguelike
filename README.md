===========================

![alt text](http://www.projectanarchy.com/sites/default/files/Project%20Anarchy%20Logo.png "Project Anarchy")

This is an example of how to create a Roguelike game using Lua in [Project Anarachy][1], showcasing the basics of how to create an isometric, roguelike on both PC and Android. 
The sample shows examples of player movement, creating ScreenMasks for Heads Up Displays, playing/stopping/reversing/ simple animations through code, as well as a few other features that you will need to get your game going. 

### Supported Features


### Getting Started

To play the game in vForge, you don't need to compile any custom code. The source code is just there for when we packaged up an executable build for distribution. Open up `Assets\Scenes\sample.scene` in vForge to play the game!
