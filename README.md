This is an example of how to create a Roguelike game using Lua in [Project Anarachy][1], showcasing the basics of how to create an isometric, roguelike on both PC and Android. 
The sample shows examples of navmesh usage, creating ScreenMasks for Heads Up Displays, integrating Havok Animation Tool characters, as well as a few other features that you will need to get your game going. 

### Supported Features

- AI and Navmesh usage through Lua
- Mouse based player movement
- Havok Animation Tool integration through Lua
- Multiple levels with basic data saving and loading
- Heads up display created with Lua and screenmasks
- Simple Inventory implementation
- Navmesh over generation over unlevel ground

### Getting Started

To play the game in vForge, you don't need to compile any custom code. The source code is just there for when we packaged up an executable build for distribution. Open up `Assets\Scenes\sample.scene` in vForge to play the game!
